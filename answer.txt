//code fragment 1
$("li").each(function(idx, e) {
 $(e).css(“color”, “yellow”); 
});
//code fragment 2
$("li").each(function() {
 $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
//code fragment 3
$("li").each(function(idx) {
 $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });

1. They are all equivalent

The first code fragment uses the second argument which is the current element under consideration

while the second and third code fragment uses the 'this' keyword which is also the current element under consdideration.

Notice the idx variable(which is the current index) is being ignored in the third code fragment
